- 👋 Hi, I’m @Qassim-Coding
- I am a junior fullstack web developper ! 
- 👀 I am very interested in creating several projects, whether applications or websites.
- 🌱 Most of the projects I work on use Javascript and Ruby on Rails. 
    At the same time, I'm perfecting my knowledge of Django and React, to increase my programming skills.
- 💞️ I'd like to work together on projects using these different languages to improve my skills. 
- 📫 How to reach me : You can contact me on LinkedIn here : https://www.linkedin.com/in/q%C3%A2ssim-osseni-1018/
